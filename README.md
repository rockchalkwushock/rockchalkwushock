<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Cody</h1>

I am an American software developer and US Navy veteran hailing from Kansas. I now live in Colombia (the country, not a city in the USA) with my wife and golden boy doggo son.
I have 5 years of experience designing, building, shipping, and maintaining production ready SaaS products. My experience ranges markets in scheduling, logistics, automation, and crypto-currency/fin-tech. I primarily works with React and TypeScript but have experience with a variety of other technologies including but not limited too: Elixir, GraphQL, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Python, and Rust.
In my free time my hobbies include reading, running, hiking, playing guitar, weight lifting, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, smoking meats & cheeses, tinkering around with IoT devices, walking & playing with my dog, taking my wife out on fancy coffee dates, and enjoying some top shelf whisky while watching my Kansas Jayhawks cut down the nets in April.
